# DPDN_for_Road_Damage_Detection_and_Classification
## Introduction
This project is to produce the submitted results of the "Road Damage Detection and Classification Challenge of IEEE Big Data Cup 2018". The mainly idea has beed presented in our technical paper "Deep Proposal and Detection Networks for Road Damage Detection and Classification". The final submitted result can be re-obtained by runing the script "results/Fusion_Results.py". Each result in the folder of "results/bdc/" can also be re-obtained by running the script "caffe/examples/ssd/predbdc2018.py" with the model in the folder of "caffe/models/VGGNet/VOC0712/SSD_1024x1024/".
